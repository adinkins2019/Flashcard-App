# Flashcard-App
This is my flashcard application.  The user is presented with a question and when the user clicks on the question, the answer is revealed.

This repository will chronicle the progression of my flashcard app from its nascent stages into final completion. Lab1_README.md details the first iteration of the Application along with a thorough walkthrough and list of required and optional features that have been completed.

You can view the first walkthrough on Imgur. Here is the url: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/zZVAoie">Click Here!</a>

So I've completed another iteration of the flashcard application.  It will be listed in Lab2_README.md and also will be added to the beginning of Lab1_README.md.  Lab1_README.md will serve as documentation for the overall progression of the application from stage to stage.

I've created the third iteration of the flashcard application. It will be listed in the Lab3_README.md files and will also be included at the beginning of the Lab1_README.md document. Lab1_README.md is more like a journal, documenting each step along the way, from creation to a finished product. In the coming days, I will included a fourth update as well.
